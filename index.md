I'm a 4th year PhD student in Agricultural & Resource Economics at UC Berkeley.
My research focuses on social networks and technology adoption in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Rwanda.

I've been supported by an NSF GRFP grant and have recently been working with the DIME unit at the World Bank.
Prior to coming to Berkeley, I was a Research Manager at Stanford University and a Research Associate at IPA - Kenya.
