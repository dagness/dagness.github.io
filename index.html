I'm a 4th year PhD student in Agricultural & Resource Economics at UC Berkeley.
I primarily study social networks and technology adoption in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Rwanda. <br/><br/>

I'm an NSF GRFP recipient and have recently been working with the DIME unit at the World Bank.
Prior to coming to coming to Berkeley I was a research manager at Stanford University
and a Research Associate at IPA - Kenya. <br/><br/>

At some point, this site will contain lots of interesting and cutting-edge research!
But not now. Feel free to reach out in the meantime.
